1. What is brecksblog?

A high performance blog in under 130 lines of code! No MySQL needed!
breckblog helps you focus on what's important: content. You need PHP and
Apache with mod_rewrite for it to work.

2. What websites are powered by brecksblog?

http://www.breckyunits.com

Contact breck7 at gmail.com if you'd like your site added to the list.

3. How do I install brecksblog?

Two ways: simple and advanced.

Simple: Download the install.php script. Upload it to your web directory. Access it in your browser, like http://yourdomain.com/pathtobrecksblog/install.php

Follow the onscreen instructions. You may have to make sure permissions are set correctly on that directory. That's it!

Advanced: Download or copy the 4 source files(index.php, .htaccess, posts.php, settings.php) into your root directory. 
Change the settings.php settings in a text editor. Save and run. You do not need install.php (or this README).

7. Known issues

- File permissions. Your file permissions have to be set correctly. Make sure posts.php and settings.php are writeable.
- Mod_rewrite. You need mod_rewrite enabled for it to work.
- Untested. This software has not been thoroughly tested.
- Password. If someone guesses your password, it's a serious security vulnerability so far.
- Brute force password guessing. There is no protection yet against brute force guessing attempts.
- Things that may break it: posts with the same timestamp or name. Having lots of posts. Getting lots of traffic while editing.
- No backups. There is no system yet to auto backup posts.php. This may be added.

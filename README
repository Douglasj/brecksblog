You want great html, go somewhere else :)

Installation:
Make posts.php writeable


Requirements:
PHP 5
Apache with Mod_rewrite enabled

Warnings:
This blogging software is not for everyone.
It is full of limitations (but easy to extend or modify).
There are bugs that will occur in rare circumstances.
The fact that there are bugs is a feature not a defect.
This is designed to work great in most cases, and not
designed to work great for rare or special needs. Feel free
to modify.
Posts use timestamps as their unique ID. Not sure what will happen if you post
two things at the same time(it will probably break).
I've tried to make this as simple as possible and I have made
decisions on how things work based upon what I believe will
appeal to the most people.
